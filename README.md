<p> This is a collection of some small projects I am working on. Here's the full list: </p>
<ul>
  <li> grade-calculator > A simple VBA script that calculates a letter grade based on a numerical grade input </li>
  <li> paper_scissors_rock > A Python script that allows the user to play the famous game against the computer in the terminal </li>
  <li> uni-mark-calc > A more comprehensive VBA script than the grade-calculator. It will calculate all current marks to determine the minimum grade required in order to pass </li>
